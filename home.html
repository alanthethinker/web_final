        <h2 class="title">5 Best Video Editing Tips for Beginners</h2>
        <p>It’s hard to learn how to edit when you’re a beginner. There’s so much information out there, and a lot of it’s pretty complicated! This list is for you if you’re looking for simple skills that will take your content to a professional level. My 10 video editing tips and tricks will show you how to make the most out of your footage effectively.</p>
    

        <h3>1.  Remove unusable footage</h3>

        <p>What is unusable footage? Well, it includes everything from mistakes like misspoken words to shots where the background noise is too loud to hear the speaker. Although you can sometimes save footage, cutting these sections is usually the best solution. After all, you don’t want a reduced-quality video because of a few rough sections.</p>
        <p>You can remove footage by selecting the problem area – for example, the beginning of the recording when you set up the camera and adjust the angle. Video editing software will allow you to delete the highlighted section. With Riverside, this process is simple - you can easily remove sections of your video with our video editor. We use Ai transcriptions of your recording where any text you delete in these transcripts, removes the matching video and audio in your actual recording. You'll get precise video cuts in less than half the time.</p>
    
        <h3> 2. Pace the video well</h3>

        <p>Pace refers to the speed and consistency of your video. A common problem video makers face is balancing their video’s pace. While it’s natural for a video to be faster in some places and slower in others, a constantly changing pace is uncomfortable to watch.</p>
        <p>You can create a sense of pace by using cuts. Slower-paced scenes will usually be longer, with fewer cuts, while fast scenes have more cuts that are closer together.</p>
        <p>When you’re editing, consider the rhythm and atmosphere of your video. You should aim to move viewers smoothly from one scene to the next. The speed of each scene should match its tone, such as a fast clip for an urgent message. </p>
    
        <h3> 3. Use cutaways</h3>
        <p>Cutaways are when one shot changes to another to show a different person or location. They are one of the most common effects used by editors to alter the pace of a scene, draw attention to something, or keep a viewer’s attention. They will be an essential part of your editing toolkit!</p>
        <p>An example of when to use a cutaway is during a conversation. Here the shots change to show who is speaking or reacting. Cutaways create a sense of dynamic movement in a scene.</p>

        <h3> 4. Trim your clips</h3>
        <p>Clips that are too long can have the unfortunate effect of losing your viewer’s attention. A scene that drags on, or periods of extended silence between people talking, creates a kind of dead space in your video.</p>
        <p>You don’t want to give your viewers reasons to click away from your content. To keep them engaged, trim your clips. By this, we mean paying attention to the beginning and end of a scene, conversation, or atmospheric shot. Is there anything there that isn’t needed? Ideally, you only want to keep footage that’s essential to your video's pace, story, or atmosphere. Anything else you should snip away!</p>
    
        <h3>5. Color correction</h3>
        <p>If you’ve never heard of color correction before, don’t panic. You might have done some color correcting before when editing photos. It simply refers to editing contrast or brightness in your video to make the coloring appear more natural.</p>
        <p>Why is color correcting important? Color correction makes your footage resemble the natural colorings of the world. This makes your video more pleasing to the eye, as well as more watchable. </p>
